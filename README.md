# The Ringbearer
This is a simple distributed hash-table implemented in Java with Akka actor system. The project is inspired by Amazon dynamo. The nodes are seen as a ring and a quorum based approach is used to ensure sequential consistency. The system is fault tolerant and can handle node failures. The system is also scalable and can handle addition and removal of nodes.

## How to run
The project is built using gradle. You can run the project in vscode or IntelliJ IDEA, or manually using gradle from the command line.
